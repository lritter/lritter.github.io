Hi, I'm Lincoln. I live in Brooklyn, NY. Thanks for visiting my site.

I'm a software engineer and engineering leader. I have a lot of experience and you can read about it on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lincolnritter/" data-network="LinkedIn" data-proofer-ignore>LinkedIn</a>.

## The Website
This site was made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) using a modified version of the [Paper](https://github.com/mkchoi212/paper-jekyll-theme) theme. It is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
I'd love to hear your feedback on this site and my work.
